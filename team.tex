Lu Feng is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Department of Systems and Information Engineering at the University of Virginia. She is also a member of the Link Lab - the center of research excellence in Cyber-Physical Systems at the University of Virginia. Previously, she was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and received her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Oxford. Her research focuses on assuring the safety, trustworthiness and performance of cyber-physical systems, drawing on formal methods, machine learning and control. She has received several awards including NSF CISE CRII Award, James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, Rising Stars in EECS, UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Scholarship, and Cambridge Trust Scholarship.

Dr. Feng's contributions are on temporal logic planning for autonomous robots. Her recent work has focused on synthesizing control protocols for robots that interact with human operators~\cite{feng2016synthesis,feng2015controller} and providing counterexamples as diagnostic information for robotic planning~\cite{feng2018cex,feng2016human}.
She has also develop novel learning-based approaches for the compositional reasoning of probabilistic models with respect to temporal logic specifications~\cite{feng2013learning,feng2011learning,feng2011automated,feng2010compositional}.

Co-PI Heydarian is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Systems and Information Engineering at the University of Virginia as well as the Link Lab. He has background and experience in developing human-behavior detection and modeling techniques for human-cyber physical systems, and formalizing systematic approaches for representation and communication techniques.
