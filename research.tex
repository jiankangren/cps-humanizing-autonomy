\subsection{Intellectual merit}
\label{sec:im}

The intellectual merit of the proposed work is to investigate models and algorithms, that can adapt autonomy in appropriate ways by leveraging human behavior. Using autonomous driving as the basis of this research the intellectual merit of this work lies in:
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,topsep=4pt,leftmargin=0.4in]
    \item the behavioral, and emotional modeling for human drivers [Thrust 1]
    \item a novel online reachability analysis for safe path planning, and control synthesis for autonomous vehicles which can take user preferences into account [Thrust 2]  , and
    \item deep neural networks for generating natural language explanations of the actions of the autonomous vehicle, and a user interface design for conveying the intentions of the vehicle to the passengers [Thrust 3] . 
\end{enumerate} 
The research spanning across the three thrusts is innovative in that lies at the confluence of human factors modeling, control synthesis, formal methods, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, to close the loop between human behavior and emotions and autonomous planning and control.
The three research thrusts and their interconnections are described next.
