\section{Evaluation/Experimentation Plan}
\label{sec:experiment}

\begin{itemize}
    \item We need to describe in detail all the experiments and testbeds we will use/develop.
    \item this is emphasized int he solitication
    \item describe how we will recruit subjects
    \item emphasize the real world experimentation plan
\end{itemize}

\textit{This section should describe how the research concepts proposed will be demonstrated and validated. It should present metrics for success. It should identify critical experiments, and describe how the research will be demonstrated, including through simulation, prototyping, and integration with real (including sub-scale) cyber-physical systems. For Medium and Frontier projects, the validation plan must include experimentation on an actual cyber-physical system.}
