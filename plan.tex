\section{Project Management and Collaboration Plan}
\label{sec:plan}
This is an ambitious proposal which addresses challenging problems in autonomous vehicles, but we have an excellent team with broad and complementary skills, the facilities to support it, and a strong basis to start from.
The proposed work will be performed by the PIs Behl, Heydarian, Bezzo, and Feng, and 4 graduate students.

%\subsection{Roles and responsibilities:}
%All 4 PIs are members of the Cyber-Physical Systems Link Lab research center at the University of Virginia.
PI Behl is an expert in machine learning modeling and data-driven control for CPS. His F1/10 autonomous racing car platform has been built by over 20 universities, and has resulted in 2 International autonomous vehicles competitions at CPS week and ES-Week. He serves on the editorial board of the SAE International Journal of Connected and Automated Vehicles. He won the best energy paper award at the American Control Conference (ACC) 2017. He is also the recipient of the 2011 Richard K. Dentel Memorial Prize in urban transportation.

Co-PI Heydarian’s research focuses on integrating user-centered considerations (i.e. human behavior, and emotional models) into the design and operation of automated systems. He has experience conducting a number of experimental studies (over 700 consenting participants) in the past.

Co-PI Bezzo's expertise falls under the control and planning of autonomous mobile robots. His research focuses on the design of resilient controller and adaptive planning techniques to improve safety, and security of autonomous aerial and ground vehicles. He has received several awards including the 2016 Robotics and Automation Magazine Best Paper Award, and the Best Paper Award at ICCPS 2014.

Co-PI Feng's expertise is on temporal logic planning for autonomous robots. She has received several awards including James S. McDonnell Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship, Rising Stars in EECS, UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Scholarship, and Cambridge Trust Scholarship.

The timeline for the proposed work  is shown in the Figure~\ref{fig:gantt}.

% \textbf{Cognitive, Behavioral, and Social Sensing:} . In his research, Heydarian has examined the impact of human preferential and behavioral differences on building energy consumption through a bottom-up approach, where users’ behavioral and preferential information were collected and integrated into building performance simulations for design and operational improvements and decision making (CITE). Through conducting a number of experimental studies (over 700 consenting participants), he has examined how psychological theories such as “default settings” or “personality traits” can influence users preferences and interaction with building systems (CITE). In the proposed research project, Heydarian will lead the effort for the deployment of sensing and modeling technologies/techniques for understanding the impact of environmental, emotional, and social factors on driver and passenger(s) behaviors. 


\subsection{Risks and mitigation plans:}

Our excellent team and access to various automotive cyber-physical systems test-beds gives us the confidence that the proposed research can be carrier out without any major hassles. While we expect some difficulties may arise along the way, these would not sabotage the effort. Examples include component failures (these can be replaced), slow runtimes of software (this will be optimized), and realism of the simulated scenarios (these will be validated by making the same subject drive both in simulation and real world and compare the behavior models). The proposed work involves the use of human subjects for social and behavioral studies and that may be perceived as a risk but the team is experienced with obtaining IRB approvals.

\subsection{Results from Prior NSF Support}
\label{subsec:prior}

Madhur Behl: (NSF-1735587); $\$2,499,238$; 09/1/2017-08/31/2021 Title: CRISP Type 2: dMIST: Data-driven Management for Interdependent Stormwater and Transportation Systems. Role: Co-PI. \textbf{Intellectual Merit:} To create a novel decision support system denoted dMIST (Data-driven Management for Interdependent Stormwater and Transportation Systems) to improve management of interdependent transportation and stormwater infrastructure systems. %Behl's role on this project is the development of a novel modeling and control framework called Data Predictive Control (DPC) for assisting decision makers in understanding and managing interdependent critical infrastructure systems. 
\textbf{Broader impact:} The research is intended to have broad impact related to national economic and security interests due to its focus on sea level rise. Paper submitted to $11^{th}$ International Conference on Urban Drainiage Modeling.
