	Abstract = {OBJECTIVEThe purpose of this study was to introduce a novel meal detection algorithm (MDA) to be used as part of an artificial -cell that uses a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).  RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe developed our MDA on a dataset of 26 meal events using records from 19 children aged 16 years who used the MiniMed CGMS Gold. We then applied this algorithm to CGM records from a DirecNet pilot study of the FreeStyle Navigator continuous glucose sensor. During a research center admission, breakfast insulin was withheld for 1 h, and discrete glucose levels were obtained every 10 min after the meal.  RESULTSBased on the Navigator readings, the MDA detected a meal at a mean time of 30 min from the onset of eating, at which time the mean serum glucose was 21 mg/dl above baseline (range 236 mg/dl), and >90% of meals were detected before the glucose had risen 40 mg/dl from baseline.  CONCLUSIONSThe MDA will enable automated insulin dosing in response to meals, facilitating the development of an artificial pancreas.

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to compare, using a 12-month time frame, the cost-effectiveness of a nonmydriatic digital teleophthalmology system (Joslin Vision Network) versus traditional clinic-based ophthalmoscopy examinations with pupil dilation to detect proliferative diabetic retinopathy and its consequences. Decision analysis techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, were used to model the use of the Joslin Vision Network versus conventional clinic-based ophthalmoscopy among the entire diabetic populations served by the Indian Health Service, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the active duty Department of Defense. The economic perspective analyzed was that of each federal agency. Data sources for costs and outcomes included the published literature, epidemiologic data, administrative data, market prices, and expert opinion. Outcome measures included the number of true positive cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy detected, the number of patients treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation, and the number of cases of severe vision loss averted. In the base-case analyses, the Joslin Vision Network was the dominant strategy in all but two of the nine modeled scenarios, meaning that it was both less costly and more effective. In the active duty Department of Defense population, the Joslin Vision Network would be more effective but cost an extra $1,618 per additional patient treated with panretinal laser photocoagulation and an additional $13,748 per severe vision loss event averted. Based on our economic model, the Joslin Vision Network has the potential to be more effective than clinic-based ophthalmoscopy for detecting proliferative diabetic retinopathy and averting cases of severe vision loss, and may do so at lower cost. },
	Annote = {Whited et al. used decision analytical tools, including Monte Carlo simulation, to compare (1) the use of a teleophthalmological system to (2) traditional clinic-based ophthalmoscopy examinations in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, finding that the teleophtahlmologic system, while more expensive on a per-patient basis, is more cost effective overall since it allows for preventative treatment of patients before severe vision loss occurs.},

	Abstract = {The proliferation of information technology (IT) in supporting highly specialized tasks and services has made it increasingly important to understand the factors essential to technology acceptance by individuals. In a typical professional setting, the essential characteristics of user, technology, and context may differ considerably from those in ordinary business settings. This study examined physicians' acceptance of telemedicine technology. Following a theory comparison approach, it evaluated the extent to which prevailing intention-based models, including the technology acceptance model (TAM), the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and an integrated model, could explain individual physicians' technology acceptance decisions. Based on responses from more than 400 physicians, both models were evaluated in terms of overall fit, explanatory power, and their causal links. Overall, findings suggest that TAM may be more appropriate than TPB for examining technology acceptance by individual professionals and that the integrated model, although more fully depicting physicians' technology acceptance, may not provide significant additional explanatory power. Also, instruments developed and repeatedly tested in prior studies involving conventional end-users and business managers may not be valid in professional settings. Several interesting implications are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The use of telehomecare has the potential to facilitate access to healthcare services for vulnerable populations. However, evidence on the implications of telehomecare on various aspects related to patients, healthcare professionals, organizations, and healthcare systems is still limited. Assessing the various effects of telehomecare for these different groups of stake-holders is thus an essential step to ensure future integration of this technology into mainstream healthcare services. A synthesis of lessons learned from the evaluation of three telehomecare experimentations targeting specific vulnerable groups is proposed. This paper presents the various models that were implemented to assess telehomecare services for vulnerable populations, explores issues related to conducing telehomecare evaluations, and provides a reflection on key factors that might influence the success of telehomecare projects. Lessons learned from these three experimentations provide valuable insights to orient the development of telehomecare services for various vulnerable groups in the population.},
